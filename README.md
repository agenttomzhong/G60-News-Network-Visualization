This repository contains the dataset, code, and visualization scripts for the paper:

**From Words to Networks: Media-driven Insights into the G60 Sci-Tech Corridor**

## Overview

We present a data-driven framework for analyzing the innovation ecosystem of the Yangtze River Delta G60 Science and Technology Innovation Corridor using large-scale news mining and multidimensional network visualization. The project includes:

- A longitudinal dataset of 3,786 G60-related news articles (2021â€“2025)
- LLM-based entity extraction and dictionary generation
- Construction of entity co-occurrence networks
- Network analysis (Louvain community detection, centrality, etc.)
- Multi-perspective visualizations (force-directed graphs, Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, maps, etc.)
